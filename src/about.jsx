          üõ†Ô∏è How We Started
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          WebX began as a small project with a big idea: "What if websites could think?" What started with simple experiments in natural language processing and recommendation engines quickly evolved into a full-fledged platform that now hosts content, tools, and insights into modern web development. Our founders, a group of passionate developers and tech enthusiasts, believed that the web could be more than just a static display of content ‚Äî it could be intelligent, responsive, and deeply human-centric.
